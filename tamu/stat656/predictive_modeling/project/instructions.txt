For this assignment, I want you to make some predictions given some training and test data.
Follow the format in the attached sample code 'codeStudents.r' for saving your predictions.
Do not deviate from this format for your submission!
Only submit test predictions
  
Predictions [35 points]
 I'll make predictions of my own (using a basic, quick approach) and get the squared error loss on some test data = R_D. 
 You'll submit your predictions, which will be scored on the withheld test supervisors, producing a test error R.
 Your grade on this part will be determined byThis 
  gradePredRaw = (R_D/R) * 100 
  gradePred = min(gradePredRaw,120)
Write-up [65 points]
 A brief writeup (no more than 500 words) describing the techniques you used to generate the predictions.
 Be very specific about what you did. Example: don’t just say “I used Elastic net regression”
 Say what features you used (even if it is all of them) and how you chose tuning parameter(s).
 Some details you should include are:
  important features you found and how you judged importance
  how you estimated the test error
  any visualizations you made about the data

You can use whatever document preparation system you like (including R markdown), but it must be submitted in .pdf
Your write-up needn’t look like an “essay”. 
You can and should use lists to summarize what you did, for instance
 Include your code as an appendix if you do not use R Markdown (this does not count against the word limit)
 IMPORTANT: Make your write-up very easy to read
 Do not include ANY extraneous output as it will be penalized
Save your write-up in camel-case as firstNameLastName.pdf
